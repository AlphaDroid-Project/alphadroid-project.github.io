Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key directories and files. This will help in navigating the codebase and making informed changes.

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for the specific programming languages and frameworks used in the project. This includes naming conventions, file organization, and code formatting.

3. **Documentation**: Refer to existing documentation for guidance on using project components and APIs. If documentation is lacking, consider creating or updating it as part of your changes.

4. **Testing**: Write tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass before submitting changes. This helps maintain code quality and prevents regressions.

5. **Collaboration**: Communicate with other team members when making significant changes or if you need assistance. Use version control tools effectively to manage changes and collaborate on code.

6. **Review Process**: Be open to feedback during code reviews and be prepared to make revisions based on reviewer suggestions.

7. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on relevant technologies and best practices to continually improve your skills and contribute effectively to the project.
8. **Security**: Always consider security implications when writing or modifying code. Follow best practices to protect against common vulnerabilities.
9. **Performance**: Optimize code for performance where necessary, but avoid premature optimization. Focus on writing clear and maintainable code first.
10. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to ensure the application can gracefully handle unexpected situations.
